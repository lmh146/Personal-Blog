    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>
        I'm a Junior Data Science Researcher at NYU working on my web development skills to help broaden my kill set and work efficiently with a variety of teams.
        Outside of coding I enjoy artistic endeavours and hope to learn more graphic design in the future.

        This blog follows tattoo artists that inspire me to spend all my money.

    <p>
        Why did you decide to specialize in cover-up tattooing?
    </p>
    <p>
        The first start was a very coincidental opportunity. 
        A client asked me for a small cover-up tattoo.
        I hesitated because I've never made a cover-up tattoo, but the client insisted that she really wanted to cover-up her existing tattoo. 
        I accepted the request and successfully completed my first challenge. Since then, many clients have started asking me for cover-up tattoos. 
        People who want to cover their existing tattoos or scars generally have bad memories of them. Cover-up tattoos often serve to heal such wounds. 
        I am very proud of this.

        Joojoo has been diligently refining her artistic style since she embarked on her tattooing journey in 2017.
        She draws inspiration form the vibrant hues found in nature, architecture, clothing, and other diverse forms.
        Her unique creations beautifully capture the essence of oil pastels, showcasing a rich tapestry of colors and a distinct textured effect on the skin.

    <p>
        This Brazilian artist has become famous for his tattoos that represent magnificent embroidered patches. 
        As a tattoo artist he always tried to do something to differentiate himself from the rest of the artists, while doing what he likes most: realistic tattoos. 
        A long time ago he had worked on the creation of embroidered caps and shirts logos, so he realized that he could mix the two things and achieve a really unique style.

    <p>

        She uses these elements with the client;s ideas to create something unique that no one else has.
        Her passion and dedication show in her work, and she continues to evolve.
